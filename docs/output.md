# phac-nml/LegioVue: Outputs

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory (by default) after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

### Preprocessing

Initial processing steps and statistic gathering

  - `*-kreport.tsv`: Kraken2 taxonomic report
  - `*-classified.tsv`: Kraken2 standard output
  </details>

[Kraken2](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki/Manual#classification) classifies input sequences based on a taxonomic k-mer database where the input sequences are mapped to the lowest common ancestor of all genomes known to contain the given k-mer.

In the pipeline, kraken2 along with bracken are used to determine if there is any/enough _L.pneumophila_ data to run through the pipeline

#### Bracken

Sequence-based Typing (SBT) of _Legionella pneumophila_ sequences using output assemblies based on the identification and comparison of 7 loci (_flaA, pilE, asd, mip, mompS, proA, neuA/neuAh_) against an allele database. The assemblies are only run when there is an inconclusive ST call as this was found to sometimes recover the ST.

_Note: if the ST results are inconclusive after both approaches have been tried, users are encouraged to review the `possible_mlsts.txt` intermediate output for that sample in the pipeline results folder under `el_gato/reads/`_

- Warn: The sample was flagged for a specific warning
- Fail: The sample has failed out of the pipeline

The `qc_message` column contains the reason for the `qc_status` and includes:
